Enter a seed keyword and this tool will let you browse down a tree of longtail keyword suggestions.

== Description ==

This is a simple tool that will help you find longtail keywords.  Enter 
your seed or root keyword and click browse. The plugin will return a navigation tree 
similar to folders on your computer.  Open a folder and the tool will find longer keywords. 
I use this as a Google wonder wheel alternative.

PLEASE keep in mind this is meant to be a very simple plugin. If you rate this plugin 
less than 5, please tell me why in the forums so I can either help you with an issue and/or improve the 
plugin.
